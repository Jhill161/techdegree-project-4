# Phrase Hunter Game using OOP
This project is a simple phrase guessing game built with vanilla JavaScript utilizing OOP methods.  Each load of the page triggers a random phrase generation function and dynamically creates elements to display a box for each letter in the phrase. This project uses Classes, and this gave me a chance to really work with 'this' to interact with each method. Think wheel of fortune.  Using the on screen keyboard, user can guess letters.  If correct they show on the tile, if not you lose a life.  Upon losing all lives, you lose and screen will change and display a message.  Upon winning, screen and message will appear, with a button to start a new game.
